PROJECT: Assembly of God Church (Non-Profit) Website

LANGUAGES EMPLOYED: HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, PHP

DESCRIPTION: This project is the second website that I created completely from scratch. Before beginning, I drafted the design in Photoshop to create a layout and user interface and then began coding in HTML and CSS. 

Features:
* This website is a simple 4-page navigational website 
* Completely scalable and mobile-friendly interface 
* Customized donation feature with slideshow and paypal button
* Custom slideshow inspired by the AOL newsfeed slideshow at the time coded in javascript
* PHP Submission used to send "Join our cause" e-mail

HOW TO VIEW
-----------
Open the home.html file and freely navigate the links in the navigator. 

***VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: This is before I learned databases, so I put all of the donation names in JSON objects which is VERY inefficient... Still wanted to put this up because its one of my original projects, but I definitely know not to do this in the future...****

COMMENTS
--------
I intentionally chose to create my own slideshow although there are obviously existing options because I really enjoy the experience of trying to create utilities and widgets from scratch. I completely see the futility in attempting to "recreate the wheel", but I find it exhilarating to figure out how a web technology works and attempting to recreate it myself.
